### 1. Configuration
#### 1.1. Cron command
With this functionality added, **CRON** command is required in order to proceed with this version of subscriptions.
```bash
# Mark processable subscriptions, so they won't be re-scheduled multiple times
* * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/bin/console mollie:subscription:begin-processing

# Process previously marked subscriptions
* * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/bin/console mollie:subscription:process
```

#### 1.2. Gateway configuration
Configuring **Recurring (cron)** subscriptions has to be configured similarly to "default" Mollie's gateway. 

#### 1.3. Configuring product's variants
In order to use recurring payments there has to be product (variant) that has to exist within order.
In order to configure one's, access any product's variants, and modify it's **Recurring settings**

### 2.1. Subscription details
Each subscription contains list of useful information once browsed.

Here's list of every order "attached" to subscription `NOTE: First order may be shared between multiple subscriptions, as it's source of their contents`, every payment, order content's and `expected` payment schedule, and it's fulfilled date.

Every **active / processing** subscription can be **paused**(and **resumed**) or **canceled**

### 3. Orders
Starting from cart, there's requirement, that **recurring** and **non-recurring** cannot exist within **one order**.

Once order's processed, there will be **one subscription each one item (not item-unit)** created, as **intervals and durations** may differ between order's products, and within **schedule** new order will be created every time, when **next** payment should be processed.
This helps individual **refunds** or **partial** subscription **pause** / **cancel**.


### 4. Customisation
By default, this plugin comes with labels, that indicate **subscription** state of product.

However, they may not fit into your template(s). To replace them, override the hookable `variant_recurring_settings` 
form Twig hook: `sylius_shop.product.show.content.info.summary`.

### 5. Final note
* Every subscription is auto-canceled after `two` payments return `negative` status (timed out / failed).

# UPGRADE FROM `2.1.5` TO `2.1.6`

### API Platform

1. API Platform 4.2: the title and description fields are no longer present (use hydra:title / hydra:description and violations instead).
   PHPUnit and Behat tests have been updated to account for these changes.

# UPGRADE FROM `2.1.2` TO `2.1.3`

### Deprecations

1. Not passing the `Symfony\Component\Routing\Matcher\UrlMatcherInterface` instance as the last argument to the `Sylius\Bundle\ShopBundle\Locale\StorageBasedLocaleSwitcher` constructor is deprecated and will be required in Sylius 3.0.

### Service configuration changes

1. The priority of the `sylius_shop.context.locale.storage_based` service's tag `sylius.context.locale` has been changed from `-64` to `64` to ensure proper execution order in the locale context chain.

# UPGRADE FROM `2.0` TO `2.1`

### General

1. The `sylius_admin_customer_orders_statistics` route has been deprecated.

1. The minimum version of Symfony 7 packages has been bumped from Symfony `^7.1` to `^7.2`

1. The `tabler` package has been updated to version `^1.3.0`. Please pay attention to the accordion element in final applications, as its implementation has changed.

### Twig Hooks

1. The `sylius_admin.dashboard.index.content.latest_statistics.new_customers` hook has been deprecated and disabled.
   It has been replaced by the `sylius_admin.dashboard.index.content.latest_statistics.pending_actions`.

1. The `history`, `cancel` and `resend_confirmation_email` hookables from `'sylius_admin.order.show.content.header.title_block.actions'` 
   hook have been deprecated and disabled. Now these templates are located in `'sylius_admin.order.show.content.header.title_block.actions.list'` hook.

1. `'sylius_shop.account.address_book.index.content.main.buttons'` hook has been deprecated and disabled. Content 
   of this hook has been moved to `'sylius_shop.account.address_book.index.content.main.header'` section.

1. `'sylius_shop.account.address_book.index.content.main.buttons.add_address'` hook has been deprecated and disabled. 
   Content of this hook has been moved to `'sylius_shop.account.address_book.index.content.main.header.buttons.add_address'` section.

1. The `price`, `original_price`, `minimum_price` hookables from `'sylius_admin.product.update.content.form.sections.channel_pricing'`
   hook have been deprecated and disabled. Now these templates are located in `'sylius_admin.product.create.content.form.sections.channel_pricing.info'`.

### Assets

#### Overview of Changes
Sylius has modernized its asset management system with these key improvements:
- Bundle-prefixed controller paths
- JSON-based configuration
- Flexible controller registration options

#### Updated Controller Paths
All core controllers now use standardized bundle prefixes:

**Admin Controllers**  

| Old Path                         | New Path                                              |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `slug`                           | `@sylius/admin-bundle/slug`                           |
| `taxon-slug`                     | `@sylius/admin-bundle/taxon-slug`                     |
| `taxon-tree`                     | `@sylius/admin-bundle/taxon-tree`                     |
| `delete-taxon`                   | `@sylius/admin-bundle/delete-taxon`                   |
| `product-attribute-autocomplete` | `@sylius/admin-bundle/product-attribute-autocomplete` |
| `product-taxon-tree`             | `@sylius/admin-bundle/product-taxon-tree`             |
| `save-positions`                 | `@sylius/admin-bundle/save-positions`                 |
| `compound-form-errors`           | `@sylius/admin-bundle/compound-form-errors`           |
| `tabs-errors`                    | `@sylius/admin-bundle/tabs-errors`                    |

**Shop Controller**  
`api-login` â†’ `@sylius/shop-bundle/api-login`

#### New Configuration System

**Configuration Files**
```text
assets/
  admin/
    controllers.json  # Admin controller configurations
  shop/
    controllers.json  # Shop controller configurations
  controllers.json # Shared controllers configurations imported via flex
```

**Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "@sylius/admin-bundle/slug": {
    "enabled": true,
    "fetch": "lazy"
  }
}
```

**Key Actions**:
- Enable/disable controllers
- Change loading behavior (lazy/eager)
- Extend with custom controllers

#### Controller Registration Methods

1. **Automatic Discovery**
    - Files in `./controllers/` directory
    - Naming pattern: `[name]_controller.js`
    - Auto-registered with Stimulus

2. **JSON Configuration**
    - Pre-configured bundle controllers
    - Managed via `controllers.json` files
    - Lazy-loaded by default

3. **Manual Registration**
   ```javascript
   // In bootstrap.js:
   import CustomController from './custom_controller_dir/custom_controller';
   app.register('custom', CustomController);
   ```
   Use for:
    - Third-party controllers
    - Non-standard locations
    - Advanced initialization

#### Migration Guide
1. Update all controller references to use new prefixed paths
2. Review [Sylius-Standard PR #1126](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius-Standard/pull/1126) for implementation details

**Note**: The old mechanism will remain functional until you actively migrate to the new system.
